## Work Experience üíª
**Machine Learning Engineer @ Easyfortech R&D (_July 2022 - Present_)**
-- Segmentation of customer details based on shopping transactions.

- Collected customer transaction data, performed data cleaning to handle missing values, and checked for
outliers.
- Conducted feature selection and feature scaling as a crucial preprocessing step before implementing KMeans clustering.
- Utilized the obtained customer segmentation to derive meaningful insights and tailor marketing strategies,
promotions, and other business decisions to each customer segment based on their transaction behaviors

**Machine Learning intern @ Emmanuel's Lanka (Pvt) LTD  (Jan 2022 -June 2022)**
-- Contributed to the project focused on automating the camera light of Jetson Nano robots
for surgical procedures in the operation theatre.

- Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams of mechanical engineers, electronics engineers, and computer
vision engineers to develop a project initiated by a senior consultant.
- Project goal: Designed an automated camera light system to facilitate the automatic detection of surgical
points, eliminating the need for manual adjustment of the light.
